# Submitting your research to a conference: writing abstracts and bios

Writing an abstract describing your project and writing a bio introducing yourself are easily an afterthought to a large-scale project.

Writing an abstract describing your project and writing a bio introducing yourself are easily an afterthought to a large-scale project. 
However, abstracts and bios are critical for sharing your work with the research community. 
Typically one must submit an abstract and bio to be accepted to present at a conference. 

Distilling complexity of ideas in a research project to a short summary, as well as the richness of your lived experience to a couple of sentences can be a daunting task. 
In this section, we discuss strategies to take the consternation out of preparing to submit your work to a conference.

## Writing a conference abstract

Although it is a short piece of writing, an abstract is an _important_ component of the project; the deciding factor in whether your paper will be shared at this meeting. 
Organsiers will typically not read every paper submitted to a conference, instead asssessing which presentations to include by reviewing the abstracts submitted. 
Target your abstract to the conference you are submitting to, highlight what is of most interest to this audience.

Follow a [formula](https://www.enago.com/academy/important-tips-for-writing-an-effective-conference-abstract/) for writing a conference abstract:

- A title: describe your topic highlighting what is most engaging or important 
- Problem statement: Start your abstract by stating the specific problem you are trying to solve
- Purpose: What is the motivation for this project? Why is it an important problem to solve?
- Methods: How did you solve the problem?

Look at [examples of abstracts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136027/) to see how your draft compares.
Use plain language over jargon and write in such a way that anyone in your domain can understand.
Avoid repetition and be concise; is not unusual for there to be character limits on abstract submissions, so it may take some iterating to reduce the abstract to the length required.
Rest the writing for at least a day, and return to it with fresh eyes. 
Sharing the abstract with collaborators is another valuable way to get fresh eyes on the writing.

## Writing a conference bio

Consider what the conference attendees would find most pertinent and interesting about you. 
You might mention where you are in your research career, a side project of interest to the community, and a hobby. 
For example, you might let people know you are a PhD student who has just built their first open-source Python package and dance Bachata in your spare time. 
Be yourself, [share your story](https://www.juneletters.com/blog/2014/12/17/writers-workshop-5-steps-to-writing-the-perfect-about-me-bio), but be even more concise than your abstract; one or two sentences is often sufficient.

## Final tips

With both your abstract and bio, target the audience of your conference, don't overthink it, tell a compelling story, and be concise. 
For example, are they domain specialists, with little interest in open source programming, or is it a broad scientific audience where the one of the most common areas of interest is open source science?
