# Submitting your research to a conference: writing abstracts and bios

<!-- trying to use references -->
Writing an abstract describing your project and writing a bio introducing yourself are easily an afterthought to a large-scale project. 
<!-- end test using references -->
Writing an abstract describing your project and writing a bio introducing yourself are easily an afterthought to a large-scale project. 
However, abstracts and bios are critical for sharing your work with the research community. 
Typically one must submit an abstract and bio to be accepted to present at a conference. 

Distilling complexity of ideas in a research project to a short summary, as well as the richness of your lived experience to a couple of sentences can be a daunting task. 
In this section, we discuss strategies to take the consternation out of preparing to submit your work to a conference.  

<!-- 
> Each of the key ideas you talk about in the introduction should have a section of its own.
> When you mention a key idea in your introduction, remember to cross reference it to the section of your subchapter where you explain it further.
> This will be useful for people who may only want to read specific parts of your content.
> See the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-crossref.html) for The Turing Way's recommendations on cross referencing.

## Writing a conference abstract

Although it is a short piece of writing, an abstract is an _important_ component of the project; the deciding factor in whether your paper will be shared at this meeting. 
Organsiers will typically not read every paper submitted to a conference, instead asssessing which presentations to include by reviewing the abstracts submitted. 
Target your abstract to the conference you are submitting to, highlight what is of most interest to this audience.

Follow a [formula](https://www.enago.com/academy/important-tips-for-writing-an-effective-conference-abstract/) for writing a conference abstract:

- A title: describe your topic highlighting what is most engaging or important 
- Problem statement: Start your abstract by stating the specific problem you are trying to solve
- Purpose: What is the motivation for this project? Why is it an important problem to solve?
- Methods: How did you solve the problem?

Use plain language over jargon and write in such a way that anyone in your domain can understand.
Avoid repetition and be concise; is not unusual for there to be character limits on abstract submissions, so it may take some iterating to reduce the abstract to the length required.
Rest the writing for at least a day, and return to it with fresh eyes. 
Sharing the abstract with collaborators is another valuable way to get fresh eyes on the writing.

## Writing a conference bio

> **Talk about your key idea in detail**. Feel free to use images, code blocks, and admonitions to communicate your ideas.
> You may break the section down into subsections if you wish.
> Remember to use the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) and Jupyter Book's [Cheat Sheet](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html) to guide your writing.
> The [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-citing.html) also contains _The Turing Way's_ recommendations for referencing and citation.

<!-- IMPORTANT!

- Use this template to create your chapter's subchapters.
- Refrain from writing very long subchapters as readers may be unwilling to read them. Rather, you should split long subchapters into smaller subchapters if necessary.
